## WHAT IS IT?

This is a Cell Cycle Agent-Based Model (CCABM) of the fission yeast. The current model was created to simulate the 
sequence of protein events of the fission yeast cell cycle while measuring the time and percentage of duration of 
each of the four cell cycle phases (G1, S, G2 and M) as part of the research journal titled “An agent-based model 
of the fission yeast cell cycle”

## HOW IT WORKS

The CCABM is based on the protein regulatory network of the cell cycle from 
[Davidich MI, Bornholdt S (2008) Boolean Network Model Predicts Cell Cycle Sequence of Fission Yeast.]
(http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001672). Each protein is represented by an 
agent and have activation, inhibition and self-degradation process. The proteins have a binary property called 
activity that represent if they are active or not, the combination of values of activity of each protein determines 
the time step in the cell cycle.

## HOW TO USE IT

The selectors for the initial conditions of the proteins are located in top of the world, biological conditions 
are the following: “Start” (1), SK (0), Cdc2/Cdc13 (0), Ste9 (1), Rum (1), Slp1 (0), Cdc2/Cdc13* (0), Wee1/Mik1 (1),
Cdc25 (0), and PP (0). 

Left of the world there is a selector to choose if links are visible or not. The setup button is to set the model
with the initial states selected in the selector for initial conditions. The bio button is to set the initial states
the same as the initial biological conditions ignoring the values set in the selector for initial states.  The go
once button is used to run one time-step and the go button is used to run the model entirely until the simulation is finished. 

Right of the world are three rows of monitors, the first row shows the current phase were the cell cycle is, the 
second row shows the time in ticks for each phase and the third row shows the percentage of duration for each phase as well.

Under the world are monitors that show the current value of activity for each protein.

## BEHAVIOR SPACE 
The CCABM is intended to be ran under biological conditions. In addition, to perform the different experiments 
to validate the model the behavior space tool was used, performing three different experiments.

Biological conditions: The model is run 100 times under biological conditions, in order to eliminate inherent variability.

All possible initial states: Run the model with the 1024 combinations of initial conditions to check the times that
the model reached the desired final state.

All possible initial states but only when Start is active: The same as the above when only is Start is active, 
resulting in 512 combinations, again to check the times that the model reached the desired final state.

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

This model can be complemented to generate a model of cancer drug studies performed in the fission yeast, first by changing the behavior of the cell cycle to match one type of cancer and by adding a type of agent that represents the drug to see when and if the drug stops the cell cycle (the cell die).
